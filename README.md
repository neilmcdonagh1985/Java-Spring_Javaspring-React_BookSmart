A group project where we designed a full-stack app for restaurant front-of-house staff to track bookings, make reservations and save the entries into a calendar. Also allows staff to change booking times and other details. The app was built using Javascript and React on the front-end, with a Java/Spring back-end.

using React, I gained valuable practice in using multiple components, fetching data from the back/end, event handling such as on-click, on-change etc, and in the back-end, I become more familiar with Spring, Postgres and how to use controller files, interfaces etc.

The user in mind would possibly be using the app whilst talking on the phone to a customer, so the calendar and available reservation times would have to be easily visible. The calendar displays the current day's bookings by default:

The user can add a new booking and customer with this form:

The bookings and customers are saved to the database and accessable on the app to the user:
